Participating in commerce is a global activity, for all humans. At Shopify, we aim to make commerce experiences better and more inclusive. Creating inclusive content is not just about reaching a global audience—it’s about ensuring each human being interacting with Shopify feels part of the experience.

Writing inclusively for commerce experiences is more than avoiding a list of words. Start by involving diverse perspectives in the planning process. Limit assumptions or biases by testing your content with a diverse audience. Recruit research participants from a variety of backgrounds, including historically excluded groups.

Be aware of your intrinsic bias and let those with lived experiences guide the way.

## Writing principles

Our language should reflect the diversity of Shopify merchants. Here are some principles for creating welcoming commerce experiences through writing.

- When talking **to people**, use language that considers others’ perspectives and lived experiences
- When talking **about people**, be descriptive only when necessary to the context, and use language preferred by the group being described
- When talking **about things**, be clear and accurate, avoiding metaphors and idioms

## Accessibility

Ableism is discrimination or prejudice against those with disabilities. It can show up in product experiences and language, even if unintentional. Considering those with disabilities will make your content accessible and inclusive.

To write accessible content:

- Center content around people, not their disabilities
- Be clear and avoid metaphors, euphemisms, and idioms
- Don’t imply that those with disabilities are abnormal, less than, or “suffering”
- Avoid words associated with disabilities to describe objects, features, or experiences

### Recommended language

#### Disable, disabled

Don’t describe actions or features as “disabled.” This can imply that being disabled is a negative state. Alternatives include “inactive,” “deactivated,” and “turn off.”

Note: Because “disabled” is a valid state for HTML elements, it’s currently considered appropriate when talking about specific element states.

![setting-toggle-disable](/images/content/inclusive-language/setting-toggle-disable@2x.png)

<!-- end -->

#### Deaf

Only use this term to refer to actual deafness, not as a metaphor. Use lowercase, unless referring to the Deaf community.

#### Handicap, handicapped

Don’t use this term to refer to someone’s disability. Be specific, such as:

- person who uses a wheelchair
- person who uses an accessibility device

#### Blind

Only use this term to reference actual blindness, not as a metaphor.

#### Insane, crazy

Avoid using these words to describe something as extreme or unbelievable.

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

- wild
- extreme
- unbelievable
- intense

#### Don’t

- insane
- crazy
- nuts

<!-- end -->

#### Just, only, easy, etc.

When marketing, it’s okay to communicate a new product or feature will simplify a complex task. But avoid saying the task itself is easy or quick. If you imply it’s easy for everyone, it can discourage people who might struggle with the task.

Although it’s okay to use them in the right context, here are some words to watch out for:

- just
- only
- easy
- simple
- quick

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

Start selling in person with these 8 steps

#### Don’t

Start selling in person in 8 easy steps

<!-- end -->

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

Enter your email address and password

#### Don’t

Just put in your email address to get started

<!-- end -->

## Anti-racist content

Depending on your lived experience, words can be harmful or triggering. Racist language expresses bias towards or against a particular race. Anti-racist language is free of bias and promotes inclusion of merchants’ lived experiences.

#### Tips

- Don’t treat perspectives that are different from yours as exotic or strange
- Don’t use phrases or terms that denote “black” or “dark” as bad or negative, versus “white” or “light” as good or positive
- Avoid metaphors and idioms since they can have racist origins or interpretations

### Recommended language

#### Grandfather in, grandfather clause

Avoid using these phrases, as they come from laws meant to circumvent or disenfranchise Black people’s rights. These laws, or “grandfather clauses,” originated in the Reconstruction era in the American South.

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

- Legacy, legacied
- Exempt

#### Don’t

- Grandfather in, grandfathered in
- Grandfather clause

<!-- end -->

#### Black hat, white hat (hacking)

Avoid these terms since they imply that “white is good” and “black is bad.”

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

- Unethical hacking
- Ethical hacking

#### Don’t

- Black hat
- White hat

<!-- end -->

#### Blacklist, whitelist

Avoid these terms since they imply that “white is good” and “black is bad.”

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

- Denylist, blocklist
- Allowlist
- Permit, permitted

#### Don’t

- Blacklist
- Whitelist
- Graylist

<!-- end -->

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

Learn how to secure a compromised account and reset blocked credentials.

#### Don’t

Learn how to secure a compromised account and reset blacklisted credentials.

<!-- end -->

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

Add no-reply[at]shopify.com to your email provider’s allowlist.

#### Don’t

Add no-reply[at]shopify.com to your email provider’s whitelist.

<!-- end -->

## Ungendered content

Gender is an important part of many people’s identity. Stereotypes and assumptions about gender can bias your language and exclude others. When you do talk about gender, be intentional. Only use gendered language if it makes your content more inclusive and accurate.

### Internationalization

Many languages lack ungendered options, like the English “they.” When possible, write in a way that avoids gendered language. For example, write “you” instead of a third person pronoun. If you’re unsure, choose the clearest option.

### Recommended language

Always use someone’s preferred gender and pronouns. If you’re not sure, use the pronouns “they/them.”

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

Call the customer to confirm their address

#### Don’t

Call the customer to confirm his or her address

<!-- end -->

Avoid asking for pronouns or gender, unless it’s required.

<!-- dodont -->

#### Don’t

![form-with-gender-field](/images/content/inclusive-language/form-with-gender-field@2x.png)

<!-- end -->

Don’t use language that associates roles, qualities, or objects with a specific gender.

<!-- dodont -->

#### Do

- synthetic
- workforce
- mail carrier

#### Don’t

- man-made
- manpower
- mailman

<!-- end -->
